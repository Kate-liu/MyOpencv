# Opencv DNN Module

This is Opencv DNN Module demo code.

ps：DNN is Deep Neural Networks (深度神经网络)


## Download caffe
Baidu Netdisk link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NzWKbwpVgfxgS024DpzaMQ 
Code: y235 




## Install package

- pip install opencv-python==4.3.0.36
    
- pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.3.0.36

- ps：install version need equality.



## Caffe

- link: [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

- prototxt: [bvlc_googlenet](./caffe/bvlc_googlenet.prototxt)

- caffeModel: Need Download in the Baidu Netdisk: 
link:[bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NzWKbwpVgfxgS024DpzaMQ).
Code: y235 .
then must put the download caffemodel file in the `./caffe/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel`


- caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) and by community contributors.


## GoogleNet

- learning: [GoogleNetDNN](./GoogleNetDNN.py)

- use the net to recognition image.
